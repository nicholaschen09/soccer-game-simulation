// Project: Simulating a Soccer Game
// Purpose: The purpose of this program is to simulate a real time soccer game
// with commentating and a scoreboard that tracks the points of both teams throughout
// the match

Testing and Debugging Documentation:

Test Scenarios:

1. Balanced Game:
   - Events: 5 goals, 5 shots on goal, 5 shots off goal, 2 yellow cards, 1 red card.
   - Expected Outcome: Balanced distribution of events.
   - Actual Outcome: As expected.
   - Notes: Confirmed equal likelihood of event types.

2. High Scoring Game:
   - Events: 10 goals, 3 shots on goal, 2 shots off goal, 1 yellow card.
   - Expected Outcome: High number of scoring events compared to other events.
   - Actual Outcome: As expected.
   - Notes: Scoring events dominated the game scenario.

3. Defensive Game:
   - Events: 2 goals, 8 shots on goal (5 blocked), 3 shots off goal.
   - Expected Outcome: High number of blocked shots indicating a defensive game.
   - Actual Outcome: As expected, but initially blocked shots were not counted correctly.
   - Notes: Debugged and fixed the issue where blocked shots were not added to total shots on goal.

4. Aggressive Game:
   - Events: 3 goals, 4 shots on goal, 2 shots off goal, 4 yellow cards, 2 red cards.
   - Expected Outcome: High number of cards indicating an aggressive game.
   - Actual Outcome: As expected.
   - Notes: Initially, yellow cards were incorrectly assigned due to a logic error. Fixed.

- I reviewed the randomization logic and confirmed equal chance of occurrence for all event types.
- Ensured the seed for randomization provided a diverse mix of scenarios.
- I manually calculated expected outcomes for each test scenario and compared them with the program's output.
- Identified discrepancies in blocked shots and card assignments, which were then debugged and fixed.
- I implemented automated tests for critical functions, such as event generation and stat calculation.
- All tests passed, confirming the correctness of these functions under various inputs.
- I fixed an issue where blocked shots were not correctly added to the total shots on goal.
- I corrected a logic error in penalty event handling that caused incorrect assignment of yellow cards.
- After conducting the test scenarios and reviewing the program's output, I made changes that allowed the program to run properly.
- All event types are now handled correctly, and the outputted stats match the expected outcomes, ensuring the game simulation's accuracy and reliability.
